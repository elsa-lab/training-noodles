Two Locals
----------

`Example link on GitHub. <https://github.com/elsa-lab/training-noodles/tree/master/examples/two_locals>`__

This is a simple example which writes three log files on local machine.

Two Servers with Same User
--------------------------

`Example link on GitHub. <https://github.com/elsa-lab/training-noodles/tree/master/examples/two_servers_same_user>`__

Similar to :ref:`two_locals`, this example simply changes the deployment
targets from local machine to remote servers.

This example also shows that switching between local machines and remote
servers is easy for Noodles.

Error Handling
--------------

`Example link on GitHub. <https://github.com/elsa-lab/training-noodles/tree/master/examples/error_handling>`__

This example specifies a nonexistent server in the spec purposely to test
whether Noodles can handle errors properly.

File Transfer
-------------

`Example link on GitHub. <https://github.com/elsa-lab/training-noodles/tree/master/examples/file_transfer>`__

This examples shows that Noodles can not only run commands on remote servers
but also on local machines.

Local Tmux
----------

`Example link on GitHub. <https://github.com/elsa-lab/training-noodles/tree/master/examples/local_tmux>`__

This example runs a short Tmux session and a long Tmux session on the local
machine.

Long Process
------------

`Example link on GitHub. <https://github.com/elsa-lab/training-noodles/tree/master/examples/long_process>`__

This example shows the ability to see the intermediate results of any long
process on the remote servers.

Train TensorFlow Examples
-------------------------

`Example link on GitHub. <https://github.com/elsa-lab/training-noodles/tree/master/examples/train_tensorflow_examples>`__

This is a more complex example to train three TensorFlow examples on two remote
servers. It combines many techniques used in the previous examples.
